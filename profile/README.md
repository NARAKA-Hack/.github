## Why NARAKA Hacks Stand Out

Unlike hacks for shooters like **HELLDIVERS 2** or **Call of Duty**, **NARAKA hacks** target stamina, melee combat, and agility. Infinite stamina alone is a game-changer, letting you chain movement and attacks forever. Add ESP vision and aimbot to the mix, and you control every aspect of survival.
